# OxeFit Python Coding Challenge

This is a simple coding challenge broken down in to two parts. We use `pytest` to check the work done by including some rudimentary unit tests.

## First Challenge: Smart Fibonacci calculator

Your employer has asked you to implement a Fibonacci number calculator in Python for reasons that are beyond you. 
You implement a recursive version only to find out that the acceptance test requires you to be able to compute fib(1000) 
and the recursive algorithm reaches a stack limit before it solves.

Your goal is to refactor the recursive fib function to pass the acceptance test.

## Second Challenge: Single-pole low-pass filter

Your employer has also asked you to implement an Alpha Filter,
 a single-pole low-pass filter that is a special case of the more general [Alpha-Beta Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_beta_filter).

There is an initial acceptance test that captures the bare minimum functionality. Make this test pass first, then we will flesh out the filter itself.
